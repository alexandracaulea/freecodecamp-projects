# Build a Product Landing Page Project

## Objective

1. Build a CodePen app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/RKRbwL).
2. I can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to complete this project.

## User Stories

1. My product landing page should have a `header` element with a corresponding `id="header"`.
2. Within the `header` element it should be an image with a corresponding `id="header-img"`. I've made a company logo to include in this element.
3. Within the `#header` element it should be a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar".
4. There should be at least three clickable elements inside the `nav` element, each with the class `.nav-link`.
5. When I click a `.nav-link` button in the `nav` element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.
6. I can watch an embedded product video with `id="video"`.
7. My landing page has a form element with a corresponding `id="form"`.
8. Within the form, there is an input field with `id="email"` where I can enter an email address.
9. The `#email` input field should have a placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.
10. The `#email` input field should use HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.
11. Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding `id="submit"`.
12. When the input with the id of `#submit` is clicked, the email should be submitted to a static page (I've use [this mock URL](https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit) provided by freeCodeCamp).
13. The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.
14. My product landing page should have at least one media query.
15. My product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.

## Testing

To test the requirements, I've use [this](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js) CDN link provided by freeCodeCamp.

## [Solution](https://codepen.io/alexandracaulea/full/QWbObOQ)

I've buit a responsive landing page with custom incremental value animation using Intersection Observer API and a custom video player.

This project was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
