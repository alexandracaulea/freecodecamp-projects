# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

In this section I will build the following projects:

- Palindrome Checker
- Roman Numeral Converter
- Caesars Cipher
- Telephone Number Validator
- Cash Register

## Additional project

While working through the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification curriculum I had to write an algorithm to convert the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. I've decided to take this challenge a bit further and implement also an UI for it.
